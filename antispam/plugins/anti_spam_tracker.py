class AntiSpamTracker(BasePlugin):
    """
    A class devoted to people who want to handle punishments themselves.

    This class wraps a few things, and handles the logic of ensuring
    everything exists (or doesnt) among other things such as
    untracking users after the valid storage interval expires

    In order to use
    this in your code, you can either:\n
     - Subclass this class and override the ``do_punishment`` method and then use it that way to keep it clean
     - Initialize this class and simply use the bool ``is_spamming()`` and do punishments based off that
     - Initialize this class and simply use ``get_user_count()`` to get the number of times the user should be punished and do your own logic

    *This mainly just depends on how granular you want to be within your code base.*

    The way it works, is everytime you call ``propagate`` you simply pass the returned
    data into `update_cache` and it will update said Members cache if AntiSpamHandler
    thinks that they should be punished. Now, you set ``spam_amount_to_punish``
    when creating an instance of this class and that is used to check if YOU
    think they should be punished, and what punishment to give when they hit that cap.

    **Basically:**\n
    ``propagate`` -> ``update_cache``, if the User should be punished we increment internal counter

    ``is_spamming`` -> Checks if the User's internal counter meets ``spam_amount_to_punish`` and returns a bool
